# BEEF
BEEF is a Base Editor Enrichment Function intended to filter CRISPR targets predicted by Doench et al. (2016) into a the subset of targets that can produce premature stop codons with the _Pm_CDA1 dCas9 base editor. Current parameters are set to filter targets that can induce a stop codon between -17 and -19 upstream of the PAM (inclusive) of 20nt target sequences.
